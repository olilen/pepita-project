# pepita-project

This is a project made for pepita.hu

- I used the mobile-first method to build a fully responsive website from a figma design file.
- Used the 7-1 Sass Architecture to build my project.
- For responsive design I used: flexbox and grid layouts, rem, %, vw/vh units, media queries.
- Fully animated design.
- Used JavaScript to make the website fully interactive.

The files:

In the source folder ("src") you can find the two main HTML files (for the tickets and collections page) and three different folders.

The "sass" folder you can find the main Sass file ("style.scss") and Sass partials in different folders (based on the 7-1 Sass Architecture).

The "assets" folder contains all the assets(icons, images) used on the site.

The "scripts" folder contains the JavaScript file.

In the "public" folder we can find the COMPILED and MINIMIZED CSS and JS files. I included this folder so I can publish it on Github Pages.
